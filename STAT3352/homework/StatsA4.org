* Problem 1
** Question
A college professor never finishes his lecture before the end of the hour and always finishes his lectures within 2 min after the hour. Let X=the time that elapses between the end of the hour and the end of the lecture and suppose the pdf of X is f(x)=kx^2 if 0<=x<=2 and 0 otherwise.

a. Find the value of k and draw the corresponding density curve. [Hint: Total area under the graph of f(x) is 1.]
b. What is the probability that the lecture ends within 1 min of the end of the hour?
c. Find mean value and variance of X. 
** Answer
*** Part A
The value of k can be found by 
1 = \int_0^2 kx^2 dx => k = 3/8

We can draw this with the following R commands:
#+BEGIN_SRC R
> k = 3/8
> x = seq(0, 2, length = 100)
> f = k * x * x
> d <- density(f)
> plot(d)
#+END_SRC

Which will yield the following image:

*** Part B
The probability the lecture ends within 1 min of the end of the hour can be represented by the following.

$F(X) = P(X \le x)  = \int_0^x (\frac{3}{8} x^2) dx$ \\
$F(Xx) = \frac{x^3}{8}$ \\
$F(1) = \frac{1}{8} = 0.125$ \\

*** Part C
The mean and variance of X can be found in R by:

#+BEGIN_SRC R
> x = seq(0, 2, length = 100)
> k = 3/8
> X = x * x * k
> mean(X)
[1] 0.5025253
> var(X)
[1] 0.2063577

** Question
The time X (min) for a lab assistant to prepare the equipment for a certain experiment is believed to have a uniform distribution with A=25 and B=35.

1. Determine the pdf of X and sketch the corresponding density curve.
2. What is the probability that preparation time exceeds 33 min?
3. What are the mean and variance value of X.
4. What is the cdf of the X.
