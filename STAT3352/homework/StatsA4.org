* Problem 1
** Question
A college professor never finishes his lecture before the end of the hour and always finishes his lectures within 2 min after the hour. Let X=the time that elapses between the end of the hour and the end of the lecture and suppose the pdf of X is f(x)=kx2 if 0<=x<=2 and 0 otherwise. 

a. Find the value of k and draw the corresponding density curve. [Hint: Total area under the graph of f(x) is 1.]
b. What is the probability that the lecture ends within 1 min of the end of the hour?
c. Find mean value and variance of X. 
** Answer
*** Part A
The value of k can be found by 
1 = \int_0^2 kx^2 dx => k = 3/8

We can draw this with the following R commands:
