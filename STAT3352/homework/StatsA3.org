* Problem 1
** Question
Each time a component is tested, the trial is a success (S) or failure (F). Suppose the component is tested repeatedly until a success occurs on three consecutive trials. Let Y denote the number of trials necessary to achieve this. List all outcomes corresponding to the five smallest possible values of Y, and state which Y value is associated with each one.

* Problem 2
** Question
An automobile service facility specializing in engine tune-ups knows that 45% of all tune-ups are done on four cylinder automobiles, 40% on six-cylinder automobiles, and 15% on eight-cylinder automobiles. Let number of cylinders on the next car to be tuned.

1. What is the pmf of X?
2. Draw probability histogram for the pmf of part (a).
3. What is the probability that the next car tuned has at least six cylinders? More than six cylinders?
** Answer
*** Part A
| X    |    4 |    6 |    8 |
|------+------+------+------|
| P(x) | 0.45 | 0.40 | 0.15 |
*** Part B
The plot can be generated from the following R commands:
#+BEGIN_SRC R
> DD <- c(4, 6, 8)
> PP <- c(0.45, 0.40, 0.15)
> sum(PP)
[1] 1
> par(mfrow = c(2, 1))
> plot(DD, PP, type="h")
> points(DD,PP,col=2);abline(h=0,col=3)
> par(mfrow = c(2, 1))
#+END_SRC

*** Part C
P(X \ge 6) = P(X = 6) + P(X = 8)
P(X \ge 6) = 0.40 + 0.15 = 0.55

P(X \gt 6) = P(X = 8)
P(X \gt 6) = 0.15
* Problem 3
** Question
An individual who has automobile insurance from a certain company is randomly selected. Let Y be the number of moving violations for which the individual was cited during the last 3 years. The pmf of Y is:

| y    |  0 |   1 |  2 |   3 |
|------+----+-----+----+-----|
| p(y) | .6 | .25 | .1 | .05 |

1. Compute E(Y) and variance of Y.
2. Suppose an individual with Y violations incurs a surcharge of $100Y2. Calculate the expected amount of the surcharge.
** Answer
*** Part A
To find E(Y) in R:
#+BEGIN_SRC R
> DD <- 0:3
> DD
[1] 0 1 2 3
> PP <- c(0.6, 0.25, 0.1, 0.05)
> sum(PP)
[1] 1
> sum(DD*PP)
[1] 0.6
> weighted.mean(DD, PP)
[1] 0.6
#+END_SRC

And to find the variance
*** Part B
* Problem 4
** Question
A particular telephone number is used to receive both voice calls and fax messages. Suppose that 25% of the incoming calls involve fax messages, and consider a sample of 25 incoming calls. What is the probability that:
1. At most 6 of the calls involve a fax message?
2. Exactly 6 of the calls involve a fax message?
3. At least 6 of the calls involve a fax message?
4. More than 6 of the calls involve a fax message?
5. What is the expected number of calls among the 25 that involve a fax message?
6. What is the standard deviation of the number among the 25 calls that involve a fax message?
** Answer
*** Part A
*** Part B
*** Part C
*** Part D
*** Part E
*** Part F
