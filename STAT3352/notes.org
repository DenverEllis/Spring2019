** Syllabus
*** Course Work
- Chapter 1: How we describe data
- Chapter 2, 3, 4: Background
- Chapter 6 - 12: Data Analysis
*** Points
- 3 exams (100pts each)
- Homework and Attendance (100 points total)
- Bonus points for the following:
  - Having your solution chosen as the distributed solution
  - Answering the In-Class Bonus Question
- Your final grade can replace your lowest exam grade
*** Misc
- We will use the ~R-project~ in this class

** Describing Data
- Researcher 1:
  - Question 1: For all _middle school students_, does attendance improve final grade?
  - Question 2: Do _male students_ have a significantly higher grade than female students?
  - Question 3: Are there any racial desparities among _all students_ graded

*** *How do we answer these research questions?*
- Question --> Collect Data --> Data Analysis --> Draw Conclussion

*** How do we collect Data?
- By random samples!
  - For example, pick 500 *random* samples to collect data from

*** Data Analysis
- Find variables to be studied. In this case, we want to observe the final grade in all questions.
- Demographics are to be observed, so we also want to track Gender and Race
- We also want to see the attendance
- All data sets have a unique ID making 5 columns of data for this set.

Example Below:

|  ID | Race | Gender | Final Grade | Attendance |
|-----+------+--------+-------------+------------|
|   1 | W    | M      |          80 |         20 |
|   2 | W    | F      |          85 |         14 |
|   3 | B    | M      |          70 |         15 |
|   4 | B    | M      |          .. |         .. |
|   5 | H    | F      |          .. |         .. |
|  .. | A    | M      |          .. |         .. |
| 500 | ..   | ..     |         100 |         11 |

*** Describing Data (continued)
To describe and analyze the example data above, we must organize it. Let see how we can do this visually with different kinds of data.
There are two types of data.

# This is a comment. Visualize the below lists as a tree where Data is the root or the stem
- Data
  - Categorical Data (race, gender) (relates to frequencies)
    - Pie chart
    - Bar graph
  - Numerical Data (final grade, attendance)
    - Basic Statistics
      - Mean
      - Median
      - Variance
      - Standard Deviation
      - Mode
      - Percentile
    - Plots
      - Stem and Leaf
      - Dot Plot
      - Histogram
      - Boxplot

*** Data Analysis (continued)
**** Mean
Find the mean of set S
- Sum the elements of S and divide by the number of elements
\textasciimacron{x} \sum S[i]/S.length()
**** Median
Find the median of set S
- Sort data from low to high
- If S.length()%2==1 then the median is the middle value
- If S.length()%2==0 then the median is the average of the middle two values
**** Mode
Find the mode of set S
- The mode is the value that occurs the most option.
- Count the frequency and return the most frequent number
- Possible that data has more than one mode when the highest frequency occurs twice
**** Dot Plot
- Draw a number line.
- For each occurence in a set place a dot on top of the number on the line
- Usefult for observing frequencies
**** Stem and Leaf Plot
# Google image for this one, it is weird. Not used often

- frequency table
- Relative frequency: divide the frequency of each sample by the sample size
** Data Analysis (continued)
*** Variance
Equation:
#+BEGIN_SRC LaTeX
s_{N - 1} = \sqrt {\frac{1}{{N - 1}}\sum\limits_{i = 1}^N {\left( {x_i - \bar x} \right)^2 } }
#+END_SRC

In R:
#+BEGIN_SRC R
var(DataSet)
#+END_SRC

*** Standard Deviation
# Equation
#+BEGIN_SRC LaTeX
\sigma = \sqrt {\mu _2 }
#+END_SRC

In R:
#+BEGIN_SRC R
// TBD
#+END_SRC
*** Percentile
- N-Percentile: The point value cut-off the first n percent of data when sorted in ascending order

#+BEGIN_SRC R
quantile(Dataset, PercentWanted)
#+END_SRC

** Data Visualization
*** Histogram
In R
#+BEGIN_SRC R
hist(Dataset)
#+END_SRC

- Determine the frequency and relative frequency for each class

*** Shapes of Distributions
- Bell Curve
- J Shape
- Reverse J Shaped
- Right Skewed
- Left Skewed
- Bimodal
- U Shaped

*** Boxplot
- Sort the set
- 5 number summary of the set
  - Minimum
  - Maximum
  - Median
  - Lower fourth
    - Median of the first half of the data
  - Upper fourth
    - Median of the second half of the data
- Detect Outlier
  - f_s = UpperFourth - LowerFourth
  - Any observation farther than (1.5)f_s from the closest fourth is an outlier
  - Any observation farther than (3.0)f_s from the nearest fourth is an extreme
  - All other observations are mild
