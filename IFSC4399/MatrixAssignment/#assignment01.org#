* Exercise 1
** Question
See the given statement in R:
#+begin_src R
M <- matrix(c(1:10),nrow=5,ncol=2, dimnames=list(c("a","b","c","d","e"),c("A","B")))
#+end_src

- What is the value of M? (First write down your answer, without using R. Then check your answer using R.)

- Write a R statement to get the maximum of each column

** Studented Evaluated Solution
The number of rows will be 5 and the number of columns will be 2. The names for the rows will be listed lowercase 'a' - 'e'. The names for the columns will be listed capital 'A' and 'B'. The numbers will be 1 through 10 split between the two columns. Since R is a columns major language, 1-5 will be in column 'A' and 6-10 will be in column 'B'. The resulting matrix ought to look similar to the following table:

|   | A |  B |
| a | 1 |  6 |
| b | 2 |  7 |
| c | 3 |  8 |
| d | 4 |  9 |
| e | 5 | 10 |

** R Evaluated Solution
#+begin_src R
> M <- matrix(c(1:10),nrow=5,ncol=2, dimnames=list(c("a","b","c","d","e"),c("A","B")))
> M
  A  B
a 1  6
b 2  7
c 3  8
d 4  9
e 5 10
#+end_src

* Exercise 2
** Question
Create three vectors x,y,z with integers and each vector has 3 elements. Combine the three vectors to become a 3âˆ—3 matrix A where each column represents a vector. Change the row names to a,b,c.

** Solution
#+begin_src R
> x <- c(1, 2, 3)
> y <- c(4, 5, 6)
> z <- c(7, 8, 9)
> A <- cbind(x, y, z)
> A
     x y z
[1,] 1 4 7
[2,] 2 5 8
[3,] 3 6 9
> rownames(A) <- c('a', 'b', 'c')
> A
  x y z
a 1 4 7
b 2 5 8
c 3 6 9
#+end_src
