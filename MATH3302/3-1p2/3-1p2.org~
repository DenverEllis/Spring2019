* Inverse of a Relation
** Definition
Let R be a relation from A to B. (Recall that this means R is a subset of AxB). The inverse of R, denoted by R^-1 is the set:

\begin{addmargin}[2em]{1em}
$R^-1 = \{(y, x): (x, y) \epsilon R\}$.
\end{addmargin}

Literally, given a relation R to find R^-1 we just swap the roles of x and y.

*** Example 1:
Consider the relation R = {(1, b), (1, c), (2, c)}. The inverse relation is R^-1 = {(b, 1), (c, 1), (c, 2)}.

For any set A, the inverse relation of I_A = {(a, a): a \epsilon A} is I_A.

The inverse relation of "less-than," R = {(x, y): x < y} is the "greater than" R^-1 = {(x, y): y < x}.

If a digraph is used to define/visualize a relation, the switching the direction of the arrows defines the inverse relation. Suppose that part of the digraph for some relation is
