** Introduction
- She likes nVidia
- Might use Azure if free

** Artificial Intelligence 501 (Intel)
- 2015, computers can recognize objects in images better than humans
- 2016, AI have near human performance on tasks
*** Definitions (AI vs ML vs DL)
- *Artificial Intelligence*: A program than can sense, reason, act, and adapt
  - Artificial Intelligence is a super set of both Machine Learning and Deep Learning
- *Machine Learning*: Algorithms whose performance improve as they are exposed to more data over time
  - Machine Learning is a subset of Artificial Intelligence
  - Two Main Types: *Supervised Learning* and *Unsupervised Learning*
    - Supervised Learning: Data set has a target column and has a goal to make predictions
    - Unsupervised Learning: Dataset does not have a supervised column and has a goal to find a structure in data.
- *Deep Learning*: Subset of machine learning in which multilayered neural networks learn form vasts amounts of data
  - Deep Learning is a subset of Machine Learning

** Learning Python
** Intelligent Agents
*** Rationality
- What is rational at a giveen time depends on four things:
  - *Performance measures*
  ...
- Rationality != omniscience
